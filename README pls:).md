# House Price Prediction using Regression Analysis (R)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using **multiple regression techniques** in **R**.  
The analysis is based on housing data (Boston Housing–style dataset) and demonstrates the full workflow of a modern regression study: data exploration, model building, diagnostics, and evaluation.

The project was developed as part of an academic course in **Modern Regression Analysis**, with an emphasis on **interpretability, statistical correctness, and reproducibility**.

# Objectives
- Understand relationships between housing features and prices
- Build and compare multiple linear regression models
- Apply polynomial terms and model diagnostics
- Evaluate model assumptions and predictive performance


# Methods Used
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Model diagnostics:
  - Residual analysis
  - Heteroscedasticity tests
  - Multicollinearity checks (VIF)
- Train/Test split for prediction assessment

Comment:
This project was completed as part of an academic course and reflects both theoretical understanding and practical application of regression analysis in R.  
While the models can be further improved, the primary goal was to develop strong analytical reasoning, correct statistical methodology, and clear interpretation of results.
